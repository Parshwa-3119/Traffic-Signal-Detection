# Traffic-Signal-Detection
This project is an intelligent traffic signal detection system based on computer vision and voice assistance. It identifies red, yellow, and green signals and gives real-time voice instructions such as "Stop", "Wait", "Go", "Turn Left", or "Turn Right" depending on the signal. Implemented using Python, OpenCV, and text-to-speech.
